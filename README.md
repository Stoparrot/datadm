![dataDM](datadm-header.png?raw=true)

DataDM is your private data assistant. A conversational interface for your data where you can load, clean, transform, and visualize without a single line of code. DataDM is open source and can be run entirely locally, keeping your juicy data secrets fully private. Slide into your data's DMs tonight.

## Demo

[ recorded demo video here ]

## Features
- [x] Load multiple tables directly into the chat
- [x] Persistent Juptyer kernel backend for data manipulation during conversation
- [x] Natural language chat, visualizations/plots, and direct download of data assets
- [x] Run entirely locally, keeping your data private
- [x] Option to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 (requires API key)
- [x] Easy to use docker-images for one-line deployment
- [ ] GGML based mode (CPU only, no GPU required) [WIP]

## Things you can ask DataDM
- [x] load data from a URL
- [x] clean data by removing duplicates, nulls, outliers, etc.
- [x] join data from multiple tables into a single output table
- [x] generate new fake data by asking for synthetic tables
- [x] ask whatever you want to your very own private code-interpreter

## Quickstart

### Colab to run in the cloud
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/approximatelabs/datadm/blob/main/notebooks/datadm.ipynb)

### Docker to run locally
```
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY={{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}} -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:latest
```

For local-mode using StarChat model (requiring a CUDA device with at least 24GB of RAM)
```
docker run --gpus all -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:0.1.0-cuda
```
